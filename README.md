## Sam Kitchen

A passionate and enthusasitc Junior Software Developer currently studying at Makers Academy. Previously I have held a successful career as a Recruitment Consultant but have taken the leap to pursue my passion, a career a Software Developer.

I am looking for a challenging Software Development role that will allow me to build upon the skills I have gained independently and through Makers.

## Skills

#### Fast & Independent Learner

The 4 month, intensive nature of studying at Makers ensure that everyone graduates as a fast learner with the confidence and skills to embrace new technologies. Within only a few weeks of beginning the course I have already built a number of functioning and useful programs.

#### Teamwork

In my previous role as a Recruitment Consultant, the structure of the team and the ways in which we work ensured that all roles that we were working on were shared equally, as well as all candidate and client responsibilities. This meant that an amicable and friendly approach to working was essential, and also a flexible approach and mindset.

Furthermore, at Makers we are required to pair program with a different person everyday. This has given me an insight into teamwork within a real software development environment.

#### Working to Deadlines

The client requests that I worked on in my previous role in Recruitment were usually worked to a 48 hour deadline, meaning that I became used to working in a highly pressurised, fast-paced environment. It was both our individual and collective responsibility to ensure that all deadlines were met no matter what.
