An analytical and passionate Junior Software Developer currently studying at Makers Academy, a highly selective software development bootcamp in London. Previously I have held a successful career as a Recruitment Consultant but have taken the leap to pursue my passion, a career a Software Developer.

I am looking for a challenging Software Development role that will allow me to build upon the skills I have gained independently and through Makers.

## Skills

#### Fast & Independent Learner

The 4 month, intensive nature of studying at Makers ensures that all students graduate as an independent learner with the confidence and skills to embrace new technologies. The self-driven nature of the Makers course encourages all students to direct their own learning. This has given me the confidence to not only take on any technical challenge but to embrace learning new technologies.

#### Problem Solving
Makers Academy provides a focus on building internal processes within students so that no matter what the size of the problem, it can be broken down into more manageable problems and an analytical and solution driven process will always be followed.

#### Teamwork

In my previous role as a Recruitment Consultant, the structure of the team and the ways in which we work ensured that all roles that we were working on were shared equally, as well as all candidate and client responsibilities. This meant that an amicable and friendly approach to working was essential, and also a flexible approach and mindset.

Furthermore, the emphasis on pair programming and team projects using agile methodology have ensured that I am fully capable of quickly fitting in to any Software Development team.

#### Working to Deadlines

The client requests that I worked on in my previous role in Recruitment were usually worked to a 48 hour deadline, meaning that I became used to working in a highly pressurised, fast-paced environment. It was both our individual and collective responsibility to ensure that all deadlines were met no matter what.
